- **Notes/** → step-by-step solutions & lessons learned  
- **Scripts/** → automation, exploit, or helper scripts  
- **Screenshots/** → terminal screenshots or reference images (__IMPORTANT__: All images are __redacted__ to preserve challenge __integrity__. They illustrate workflow and learning progress _only_. __No solutions or password data are shown.__) 
- **General/** → miscellaneous or cross-game notes
